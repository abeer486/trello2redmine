# trello2redmine

This is a tiny tool I've written to migrate all of our issue tracking data at once. It uses Trello's JSON export feature and the JSON flavour of [Redmine's REST API](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api).

This tool also works with Plan.io

We had been using [Trello](http://trello.com) as a stop-gap solution while our internal services (including [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org)) were being set up. Hence the limited scope of support for features â€“ it was a one-time operation, and I don't really have a vested interest in the application, but it may be of use to others.

## Dependencies

Tested with Python 2.7, but was written with Python 3 compatibility in mind.

Beyond the standard library, the script only requires [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/) for HTTP support.

## Configuration and usage

Edit [trello2redmine_config.py](trello2redmine_config.py) and fill in the details of your installation. Then just run the script.

## Known issues

Not all features of Trello are supported. What works:

* creating Redmine issues from Trello cards,
* importing Trello card comments as Redmine issue comments,
* importing Trello checklists as plain text, appended to the issue description,
* mapping Trello users to Redmine users,
* mapping Trello lists to Redmine statuses,
* mapping Trello card labels to Redmine priorities.

What doesn't:

* multiple Trello card assignees: corresponding Redmine issue will only be assigned to the first one in Redmine,
* everything else.
